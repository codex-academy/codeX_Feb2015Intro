## T3 One square changing colours

> This task requires HTML, CSS & JavaScript

Create 3 files:

* task3.html - all HTML in here
* task3.css - all CSS in here
* task3.js - all JavaScript in here

Using the above 3 files create a web page:

* that displays a white square that is 300px by 300px with a black border that is 5px thick
* add two buttons under the square: one with text 'Make red' the other with 'Make green'
* when the 'Make red' button is pressed it should make the square red.
* when the 'Make green' button is pressed it should make the square geen.


**The HTML should look like this**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>header!</title>
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="task3.css">
	<script type="text/javascript" src="task3.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
	<!-- HTML goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

Once done add your changes to git by using the same commands as you used for the tasks above.
