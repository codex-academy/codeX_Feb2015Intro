# codeX February 2015

A big welcome to Project codeX! We hope that you will enjoy this journey with us and that you will learn and apply lots of new skills in the process. Arriving at codeX you might wonder where is the class rooms? There are non! It is just you, your fellow coders and us your mentors and the BIG world wide web.

## Assumptions

This introduction assumes that you have completed both these courses in Codecademy:
 * [HTML & CSS](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web)
 * [Javascript](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript)

If you haven't completed them yet it's no train smash! Just complete them before you go any further.

## Now what?

After completing all those courses in Codecademy you must be feeling quite chuffed wit yourself and you have good reason too! You put in the hours, you argued your way through the challenges and you have the badges to show. Now we are going to remove the side wheels, things might start feeling a bit unstable. You will be unsure on what code to use where, but this is all pretty normal. 

Just to prove to you that you are not alone in [read this quickly](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard).

So now you know that you are not alone let's get going.

## Overview

### Register

So we would like you to register for a few online  that we will be using at codeX. 

Please register on there and familiarise yourself with these tools.

So quickly go and register at:
* http://www.github.com
* http://stackoverflow.com
* http://twitter.com

### Tools of the trade

* Master the command line - [Command line mastery 101](command_line.md)
* Some software to install - [Install these](software_to_install.md)
* Version control with GIT - [Get to know Git](know_git.md)

## Let's code

So far most of the code you might have been written inside of Codecademy, that is a about to change. It reality most software is written in text editors or a more adanced text editors called and Integrated Development Environment or IDE for short. We will use a text editor called, Sublime Text and later you will be introduced to an IDE called Eclipse.

* [Debugging & Tools](debug_tools.md)
* [Let's do some coding now] (lets_code.md)

### Javascript on the command line

So far all the Javascript that you wrote was running inside of the web browser, by using node js, or node just for short, you can run javascript programs from the terminal, without the need for a web browser. This allows you to use Javsscript to write some programs that does not depend on the web browser such as accessing data in a database for example.
