## T1 Create Red and Green Squares

> This task requires HTML & CSS

In a file called task1.html create two squares that are 300px by 300px with a black border that is 5px thick.
The first square should be red and the second square should be green. Be sure that your HTML file is properly formed - you can use the basic HTML template from Sublime Text for this as described above.

> For this task create the CSS in a style tag in the head of the HTML file

**The HTML should look look something like this**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>header!</title>

	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="">

	<style type="text/css">
	/* CSS goes here */
	</style>
</head>
<body>
	<!-- HTML goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

Once you are done add your changes to git by using these commands:

* `git pull` to get any remote changes
* `git status` to see what changed
* `git add .` to add everything to git
* `git commit -m "task 1 is done"` to commit your changes to git
*  `git push -u origin master` to push your changes to github
