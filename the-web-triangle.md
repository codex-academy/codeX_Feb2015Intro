The structure of every web page looks a bit like this. It's a triangle because the balance should mostly be like that: lots of HTML, quite a lot of CSS, and as little JavaScript as possible.

At the base you have your **HTML**. It's the **structured content** of the page: headings, paragraphs, images, videos.

On top of that you have your **CSS**. This handles the **presentation**: colours, fonts, layout. Note that it's a separate layer: see, there's a line there and everything. It exists apart from the structure and content (the HTML) of the page.

At the very top, in the tiny triangle, is the **JavaScript** (JS). This adds behaviour and interactions to the page. It's the most fragile part of the three. An error in the code (perhaps introduced at midnight by a sleepy developer as a "quick fix") can break the whole block of the JS.
