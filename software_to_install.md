#Software to install

##Install from the command line, using a package manager

As you already know, the command line allows us to run programs to complete some tasks. One of those tasks is installing new software on your computer. 

Ubuntu has a package manager  called ```apt-get```which allows you to easily install software on a server or PC. 'Package' refers to all the files in the program you install on the computer.

In a termnal window on Ubuntu type ```apt-get``` and press enter.

> Using ```sudo``` we can install software as administrator. It will prompt you for a password

Before you do anything execute this command:

```sudo apt-get update```


Now let's use ```apt-get``` to install some software  that we will need using the ```apt-get install <package to install>```:

* ```sudo apt-get install git```
* ```sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy```
* ```sudo apt-get install npm```

## Installing binaries:

Sometimes we need to download some programs from the internet to install. On Ubuntu these files normally have a ```.deb``` extension.

Note: There will be a flash drive avialable so that you don't need to download these programs.

Install these programs now:

* Sublime Text
* Google Chrome
