# Debugging and tools


## Debugging

As you write software you will make mistakes a lot.

Sometimes it will be easy to find a problem or bug, and sometimes you will struggle. Sometimes it will feel impossible. Relax! This is an integral part of programming. It will drive you semi-insane, but it is a skill you need to master.

A bug in software development refers to a problem. If a program has a bug it means that it has an issue which stops it from working, or it doesn't work as we expect. Finding bugs in JavaScript can sometimes be frustrating, to say the least. Luckily the Chrome web browser comes with some tools that help us find the problems in our code: Developer Tools and the JavaScript Console.

To access them:

* Click on the three lines to the right of the address bar in your browser
* Then click 'More tools'
* Click 'Developer Tools' in the options available
* A panel will appear at the bottom of the screen in Chrome

These will allow you to do various useful things such as:

* Identify HTML Elements by clicking in the browser
* See which CSS rules are being applied to a selected element
* Switch off the CSS being applied to a selected element
* Look at the JavaScript source code used by your web page
* Add a breakpoint in JavaScript source code

These are just a few of the things you can do in Chrome's DevTools. Other browsers have similar capabilities, but sometimes you need to install a plugin. In Firefox you can install the excellent Firebug plugin to get developer support.

### Text Editor

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is a text editor with lots of nice features which make your life as a developer much easier. (Another popular editor is [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). It's free to download and try, but you need to buy a license for continued use.)

A few of those features include:

* Basic code completion, based on content in your file
* Syntax highlighting
* HTML tag completion
* HTML file basic templates

Let's try some things:

* Create a file called index.html, and open it in your text editor
* At the first line in the file type `html`
* Press `tab`
* What happened?
* Save the file
* In the body tag type `h1`
* Press `tab` again
* What happened?
* In the body of the tag you just created type 'Hello, world!'

Now that you're more familiar with the tool set, you're ready to write some code.
