# Debugging and tools

## Debugging

As you write software you will make mistakes a lot. 

Sometimes it will be easy to find a problem or bug, sometimes you will struggle... sometimes it will feel impossible. Relax! This is an integral part of programming... It will drive you semi insane, but it is a skill you need to master.

A bug in software development refers to a problem. If a program has a bug it means that it has an issue which stops it from working, or it doesn't work as we expect. Finding bugs in Javascript can sometimes be hard and a bit frustrating to say the least. Luckily the Chrome web browser comes with some tools that go a long way to help us find the problems in our code.

## Chrome Developer Tools

They include:

* Developer Tools
* Javascript Console

To access them:

* Click on the three lines to the right of the address bar in your browser now
* Then click 'More tools' 
* Look for 'Developer Tools' and 'Javascript Console' in the options available.
* When you click either one of them a screen will appear at the bottom of the screen in Chrome. 
 
These will allow you to do various useful things such as:

* Identify HTML Elements by clicking in the browser
* See which CSS tags are affecting a specific element
* Switch of the CSS styling at affects the selected element
* Look at the Javascript source code used by your web page
* Add a breakpoint in Javascript sourcecode

This is just to mention a few of the things you can do in Google Developer tools. Other browsers have similar capabilities, but some times you need to install a browser plugin. In Firefox you can install the excellent Firebug plugin to get developer support. 

### Sublime Text

Sublime Text editor is a text editor with lots of nice features which make your life as a developer much easier.

A few of those features includes:
* Basic code completion - based on content in your file
* Syntax highligting
* Html tag completion
* Html file basic templates

Let's try some things:

* Create a file called index.html in Sublime text
* At the first line in the file type `html`
* Now press 'tab'
* What happened?
* Save the file...
* Now in the body tag type `h1`
* Press press 'tab' again
* What happened?
* In the body of the tag you just created type 'Hello World!'

Now that you're more familiar with the tool set, you're ready to write some code.
